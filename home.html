      <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="bio">
          <p>Hello world! Iâ€™m a french full-stack developer based in Melbourne.
          <br>
          After working for 3 years as a social worker, mainly with asylum seekers and refugees I left France to travel in Australia. The country closed its borders on month after my arrival and I stayed there for 3 years working as a tractor operator and traveling around in my van.
          One day, I was listening to a podcast about a guy who learned how to code doing a coding bootcamp with Le Wagon. Something clicked in me and I new immediately I wanted to do the same thing.
          <br>
          The bootcamp was an amazing experience and I immediately enjoyed coding. I love creating the aesthetic of a website but also working on the logic of the back-end. I graduate arch 2023 from Le Wagon Bali and I am now looking for my first job as a developer.  I am a highly motivated and adaptable individual
